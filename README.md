# Loan Default Prediction
Prediction of Loan Default based on a data set that includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.
In this project, we will use different classification algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, and k-NN to predict whether a certain loan is paid off on time. 
We will then evaluate and compare their performance to select the best performing algorithm.
